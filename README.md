# Circle Drawer App

This is a simple program that allows you to draw a circle with an interactive slider for defining the radius. It has been built using the Bokeh and Streamlit libraries for a quick and simple representation.

## Installation

Before running the program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hzloc/circle-drawer-app.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd circle-drawer-app
```
3. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To run the app locally, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
This will start a Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Instructions

1. Move the slider to adjust the radius of the circle.
2. The circle will update dynamically as you move the slider.
3. You can interact with the circle by panning and zooming using the Bokeh tools.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Bokeh
- Streamlit

## About

This project was created as a simple demonstration of using Bokeh and Streamlit together to create interactive visualizations in Python.
